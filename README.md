Works but needs to be updated to store images of books

# Created backend  
1. npm init -y
2. npm install express mysql2 nodemon cors

# Created frontend  
1. npx create-react-app client
2. npm i react-router-dom
3. npm i axios


# Run and stop program 
docker-compose --up build

docker stop

OR YOU CAN RUN USING: 

npx start both backend and client

check index.js for the port number for backend

localhost:3000 is client
